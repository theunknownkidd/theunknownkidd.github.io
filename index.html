    <h1> What Is A PNG Best For </h1> PNG is an excellent file format for wireframes where thereâ€™s a lot of text and
    straight lines. They also work great for screenshots. This image format retains its high quality even when
    compressed, and works for both complicated and simple images </p>

    <h1> What Is A JPEG Best For </h1> JPG files are widely used because the compression algorithm significantly reduces
    the size of the file, which makes it ideal for sharing, storing, and displaying on websites. However, this JPG
    compression also reduces the quality of the image, which might be noticeable if it's highly compressed. </p>
